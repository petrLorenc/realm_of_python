## Disclaimer

This workshop is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's youtube video series on neural networks - mainly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0

My approach was that I have watched it several times and then tried to reproduce it from scratch (memory) because it was very educational. Now I wanted to give you a sneak peek into what I have learned/"refreshed from memory".

## Takeaways
   * You should have intuition about why the code below works and why it has this "interface".
   * You should have intuition about what gradient is and how it is used in the context of neural networks.
   * Be motivated to learn more :)
