# Content of 3x3h workshop 

I ran this workshop for my colleagues, who are JavaScript developers but also work on Python projects.

I hope it can be educational even for Python developers, as I tried to cover most of the typical topics in a clear and approachable way. It was an in-person, hands-on workshop.
