# Realm of Python

This repository is a collection of Python code snippets, examples, and best practices. It is a part of the of the bigger effort to provide some "hands-on" experience on different aspect of Python. It does not aim to replace any other comprehensive materials but more to provide a quick reference to some of the most common problems and solutions. It can be also used as presentation materials in some cases.

```shell
# be aware of `poetry config --list`
# be aware of virtualenvs.in-project

poetry install --no-root
```
